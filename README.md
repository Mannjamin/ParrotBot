### How to Summon / Install ParrotBot
1. Download this repository as a Zip.
2. Un-zip the file into a suitable workspace location on your drive.
3. Locate the file and open it in a Command-Line-Interface such as CMD or Powershell. 
4. input "npm install discord.js"
5. Once the download is complete, Open the config.JSON under json_files and input your Bot Token.

    _(If you have not done this yet, please go to this guide https://twentysix26.github.io/Red-Docs/red_guide_bot_accounts/)_
    
6. Now your bot is functional and has been added to your discord. Leave it offline for now. 
7. Go to parrot.js and edit the file in your favorite Text-Editor.
 
    Change "INSERT_NAME_OF_CHANNEL_HERE" to the name of your chosen Discord Channel.
    
    **THIS IS NECESSARY. If you do not do this, your discord server may blow up with parrots and you will not be able to delete them all. Please also note, I take no responcibility for any user who uses this bot without properly handling it.
    
    This is looping bot. It will not stop unless you tell it to. It is imperitive it only functions in one channel.**
   
8. Parrot bot is now ready for its first dance. To do this, Open the file directory within your Command-Line-Interface again and type "node parrot.js".

9. Your Bot is now alive. Say something within your chosen channel to make it wake up. There is a small delay before the first SQUARK so be patient. 

**SECONDARY DISCLOSURE:**
**I built this bot after a few friends began spamming a parrot within a discord. The bot itself turned out to be so funny I decided to make this public.**
**I TAKE NO RESPONCIBILITY FOR THIS GLORIOUS MEME DESTROYING YOUR DISCORD SERVER**
**I therefore suggest you blame the parrot. While it cannot hear you, it will dance to please you anyway.**
__Handle this bot with care.__

Enjoy!
